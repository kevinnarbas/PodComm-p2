# **PodComm** <small>*- An app for the podcast listening community.*</small>
### Unit 2 Project! 

â†’ Click there to get to [Podcomm!](https://podcomm.herokuapp.com/)

Inspiration for this app came from my love of podcasts and not finding a hub for just podcast talk.  I've seen and are part of many facebook groups but those are very, *biased*, I guess you can say towards the actual podcast.  Most memebers are fine when recommending other podcasts but there are always those *few*. For this webapp I want to unite all podcasters where anyone can post their opinions about their favorite and not so favorite podcasts.

## Early work pages that were stubbed up

I had this stubbed up fairly early into the project week with lots of help from Skeleton CSS framework for making the textarea and buttons really easy to work with and they just fit really well even though they are blue. Im using a pea in a pod (cause you know pea like 'p' and pod for podcast, yeah kinda cheesy but hey) reference in my app so thats where the green is coming from. 

Some problems Ive come in contact and dealt with are:
- I had to refactor my user code a couple of times to make the index page only render the users podcasts and not *all* of them.
- Other refactoring things like the way I reference the search items and adding some things to schemas that then needed to be changed on all pages they appear on.
- Figuring out how to work with Skeleton on the fly.
- Having to add a bit more pages then I'd have hoped for.

## Heres a more updated view of my PodComm

#### This picture doesnt do this landing page any justice because the main title actually gradually goes light to dark

#### This is the main landing page once a user logs in and has added some 'peas' to their *pod*

#### This is the 'new' page where a user can add a 'pea' to their *pod*.

#### Here we have the pea deets (podcast details) page displaying the information the user has entered in the 'new' page and an enrichment (review) of the podcast that the user can enter

#### Here is the edit page for a specific podcast if you left something out or just want to edit it in any way.

#### The next two show the search page and just how elements come up once searched.

## Here I did another refactor
#### Style-wise that is. Functionality is that same so I'll try and keep things consistent. All i really added was some icons to make the pages look a little less flat.  I also added some animations to the buttons.  Originally it was just supposed to be the 'Already logged in?' button on the landing page if you found yourself back at that page somehow, but I had the idea of just adding it to all the buttons to make them more fun.  I already had a fade animation on the 'Pea Deets' so i didnt want to add onto that but since skeleton uses two classes for buttons I used that to my advantage.
