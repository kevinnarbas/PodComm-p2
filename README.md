# **PodComm** <small>*- An app for the podcast listening community.*</small>
### Unit 2 Project! 

Inspiration for this app came from my love of podcasts and not finding a hub for just podcast talk.  I've seen and are part of many facebook groups but those are very, *biased*, I guess you can say towards the actual podcast.  Most memebers are fine when recommending other podcasts but there are always those *few*. For this webapp I want to unite all podcasters where anyone can post their opinions about their favorite and not so favorite podcasts.
