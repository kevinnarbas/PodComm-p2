Inspiration for this app came from my love of podcasts and not finding a hub for just podcast talk.  I've seen and are part of many facebook groups but those are very, *biased*, I guess you can say towards the actual podcast.  Most memebers are fine when recommending other podcasts but there are always those *few*. For this webapp I want to unite all podcasters where anyone can post their opinions about their favorite and not so favorite podcasts.

I had this stubbed up fairly early into the project week with lots of help from Skeleton CSS framework for making the textarea and buttons really easy to work with and they just fit really well even though they are blue. Im using a pea in a pod (cause you know pea like 'p' and pod for podcast, yeah kinda cheesy but hey) reference in my app so thats where the green is coming from. 

Some problems Ive come in contact and dealt with are:
- I had to refactor my user code a couple of times to make the index page only render the users podcasts and not *all* of them.
- Other refactoring things like the way I reference the search items and adding some things to schemas that then needed to be changed on all pages they appear on.
- Figuring out how to work with Skeleton on the fly.
- Having to add a bit more pages then I'd have hoped for.
