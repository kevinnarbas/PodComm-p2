Kevinn, phenomenal project my man. This definitley was one of the best demostrations I've seen yet for project 2. Your app is flush with features that will keep users engage, and coming back for more. On top of that your CSS is top notch, and professional. I believe this app would have a high accessiblity rating, which is splendid from a UI/UX point of view. 

I do appreciate the time you put into planning. I'm certain it made the development process as a whole much easier to navigate. Your <code> readme.md </code> file is also very detailed, which I'm certain any employer would be more than happy to review. From experience attention to detail is an important skill that doesn't come easy for most. You my friend, got it. 

There are a few minor CSS things You can fix. The title on the landing page as no margins, or padding. In addition I believe that the forms themselves could be re-organized to be more effective, and appeasing when visiting. 

You literally left me with nothing more than CSS to talk about. Great job man, I'm really excited to see how your P3 will come along!
